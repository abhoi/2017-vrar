title: Thoughts on Google Translate and AR Issues
---

#**Google Translate**
The plethora of augmented reality (AR) applications found on most smartphones/tablets today includes apps such as Quiver ([quivervision.com](http://www.quivervision.com)), Pok√©mon Go ([pokemongo.com](http://www.pokemongo.com)), and even Google Translate ([translate.google.com](http://translate.google.com)).
## Advantages

   (a) **Portability**: Phones and tablets are ultra-portable and allow users to move about, wander, and explore large areas without any major restrictions (battery life is an exception). AR apps running on these devices makes these apps portable as well.

   (b) **Minimal Setup**: Unlike other AR implementations, AR apps require almost zero setup from the user end. The user just needs to download the app from the App Store and run the AR app. The installation portion of the experience is almost non-existent.

   (c) **Fast Updates**: To improve AR app performance or deliver new content, the app developer just needs to add the changes and push an update to the app. This is fast, efficient, and inexpensive for both the developer and the user.
## Disadvantages

   (a) **Information Control**: When AR apps are developed, one concern is the amount of information. How much information should the user be allowed to experience at one time without feeling inundated? The user experience should be clear, concise, and clear of redundant views.

   (b) **Privacy Concerns**: Apps such as Google Translate store the searches or results. This data is fair use for Google to use in their other products when servicing the user. They can share this information with advertisers as well. This raises a concern of privacy and what data should be protected.

   (c) **Limited Functions**: As of right now, there is not much AR apps on smartphones/tablets do besides showing 3D models and replacing text on camera.
## Applications

Various applications of smartphone/tablet AR apps include **education in the classroom, scientific exploration (chemistry, biology), and advertisement**.

So these are the various AR/VR platforms and their respective advantages and disadvantages. A doc version of this post can be found at [WEEK1_ARVR_comparison](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1sing3rtt7rn99q/WEEK1_ARVR_comparison.docx?dl=0).
