# **Google Translate**

Google Translate ([translate.google.com](http://translate.google.com)) is considered the gold standard for translation between various languages. It is not surprising to see the addition of "live translation" aka "image translation". This feature succeeds in segmenting an image or live camera feed and recognizing foreign characters. Not only that, it also succesfully supersedes the original text with an English translation (assuming foreign language to english translation is required)!

Let us first see three examples of such translation that I took in various locations on West Taylor Street here in Chicago.

## 1. **Spanish to English**

The first image shows the original Spanish text taken from the Camera app. The second image shows the live translation feature Google Translate has. Speaking of accuracy, the algorithm did a fine job in translating the text. However, it was a pretty easy one to do.

## 2. **French to English**

Again, we see a similar situation where a piece of French text needs to be translated. In this case, however, we see the application's lack of accuracy when translating the above text. It does a great job translating the syntactic meaning of the words, but fails to translate its semantic tone.

## 3. **Chinese to English**

The Chinese text example worked really well considering the amount of text the app had to parse through to translate into English. The accuracy can be considered reasonable for the amount of translation done. One thing to notice in live usage was the frame rate considerably dropped to below 15 fps which is a user experience nightmare.

## Thoughts on Possible Future Use

Let us discuss how this technology can be effectively used to aid people all around the world.

   (a) **Travel**: One of the best and currently used f

The plethora of augmented reality (AR) applications found on most smartphones/tablets today includes apps such as Quiver ([quivervision.com](http://www.quivervision.com)), Pok√©mon Go ([pokemongo.com](http://www.pokemongo.com)), and even Google Translate ([translate.google.com](http://translate.google.com)).
## Advantages

   (a) **Portability**: Phones and tablets are ultra-portable and allow users to move about, wander, and explore large areas without any major restrictions (battery life is an exception). AR apps running on these devices makes these apps portable as well.

   (b) **Minimal Setup**: Unlike other AR implementations, AR apps require almost zero setup from the user end. The user just needs to download the app from the App Store and run the AR app. The installation portion of the experience is almost non-existent.

   (c) **Fast Updates**: To improve AR app performance or deliver new content, the app developer just needs to add the changes and push an update to the app. This is fast, efficient, and inexpensive for both the developer and the user.
## Disadvantages

   (a) **Information Control**: When AR apps are developed, one concern is the amount of information. How much information should the user be allowed to experience at one time without feeling inundated? The user experience should be clear, concise, and clear of redundant views.

   (b) **Privacy Concerns**: Apps such as Google Translate store the searches or results. This data is fair use for Google to use in their other products when servicing the user. They can share this information with advertisers as well. This raises a concern of privacy and what data should be protected.

   (c) **Limited Functions**: As of right now, there is not much AR apps on smartphones/tablets do besides showing 3D models and replacing text on camera.
## Applications

Various applications of smartphone/tablet AR apps include **education in the classroom, scientific exploration (chemistry, biology), and advertisement**.

So these are the various AR/VR platforms and their respective advantages and disadvantages. A doc version of this post can be found at [WEEK1_ARVR_comparison](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1sing3rtt7rn99q/WEEK1_ARVR_comparison.docx?dl=0).
