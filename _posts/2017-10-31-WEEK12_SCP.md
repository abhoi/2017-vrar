For the Student's Choice Presentation portion of the CS491 - Virtual and Augmented Reality class, I would like to talk about augmented reality based navigation. Particularly, this specific application of Apple's ARKit to develop a unique navigation application using AR and iPhone's camera.

The application was developed by [Andrew Hart](https://github.com/ProjectDent). The application cleverly uses two aspects of Apple's frameworks: ARKit and CoreLocation. It uses GPS data in addition to highly accurate AR to overlay information onto the screen. The first application of this is when you want to find a location on maps and need walking directions to the location. A video demonstrating the storyboard is as follows:

A second great use is to highlight common buildings and city structures when panning over them. An example:

There are many possible applications and ways to expand upon this idea and using the same technologies...
