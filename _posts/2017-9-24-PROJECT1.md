This page declares, defines, and provides an exposition for Project 1 for CS 491 - Virtual and Augmented Reality (Fall 2017) class.

## **Project Description**

The project description was to create a VR environment for your ideal office space. This space was to be inspired by the new generation Technology startup offices which contain non-traditional furniture and equipment such as bean bags, vending machines, and open segment desks. The application was developed using Unity3D [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com) with the [SteamVR Plugin](http://store.steampowered.com/steamvr). All imported models are from [3DWarehouse Sketchup](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com). Custom models were designed and created from ground up using [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com).

## **How to Use**

There are two main ways to test the application for your own use

**1.** Run the executable (.exe) file directly. Keyboard controls are mentioned on the screen (WASD). For HTC Vive controller input, you need to download and install [SteamVR Plugin](http://store.steampowered.com/steamvr).

**2.** Download and install [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com) and import the project folder. Then, press the **PLAY** button to run application inside the Unity Editor. This requires more time and only recommended if you wish to edit/add some stuff to the project.

## **What Can You Do with the Application?**

There are many features implemented in this project. This involves physics simulations, collisions, triggers, and audio sounds.

**1. You can pickup and throw various objects and you can grab onto them and catch them in mid air (you need to be really good with VR controllers for that). Following is a list of things you can grab and throw:**

	- EARTHBALL
    - PENCILCASE
    - KNIFE
    - PAPERWEIGHT
    - WATERGLASSES
    - IPHONE
    - CHESSBOARD

**2. Many objects support BoxColliders only so you can drop stuff on them without the objects falling through. Some of the objects are:**

	- CABINET
    - TRASHCAN
    - CUTTINGBOARD
    - BENCHES
    - SEGMENTDESKS
    - CHAIRS
    - TABLE

**3. You can click on various applications to trigger sounds such as Mac startup sound and you can loop through 4 songs by clicking on the iPhone on the table! Some items even have sound triggers when they fall onto a surface! Following are the items with sound triggers:**

	- PAPERWEIGHT
    - WATERGLASSES
    - IPHONE
    - IMAC
    
**4. Light switches are provided so you can turn on and off any of thE lights as you want. Two of them are:**

	- AB_CHANDELIER_LIGHTSOURCE
    - AB_FLOORLAMP_LIGHTSOURCE
