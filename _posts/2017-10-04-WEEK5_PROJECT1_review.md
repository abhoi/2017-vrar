In this post, I will download, run, examine, and comment on other projects submitted for PROJECT 1 in the CS 491 - Virtual and Augmented Reality class. The two projects I have selected are ones I found well implemented and carefully thought out. This review is more of a personal comment than a formal review.

Let us explore start with the first project I found awesome!

# 1. TEAM 1 (Amico, Simone | Foglio, Matteo | Milanta, Andrea)

At first glance, the scene of their project looks simple and similar to every other project in the class. However, at closer inspection and probing, the project seems to deliver new concepts not mentioned in the project requirements. Before going into too much detail, the team implemented some really cool concepts such as music looping through wand interactions, GameObject creation through colliders, custom lighting, and extension of two rooms in a singular classroom. Let us go into details as to how.

## Interactions

Firstly, I love how they managed to implement GameObject creation with the Coke vending machine. Whenever you tap on the Coke vending machine button, a coke bottle drops from the machine. That would be creation of a GameObject when some interaction is done. Why don’t we see that through a gif interaction instead of an image:

That is clearly a cool concept that was implemented and I have not seen that with any of the other teams (including mine).

## Sound Loop

The second thing I found great was the sound looping. We implemented in our project too, but this team added the ability to pause music instead of just stopping it. My sound loop works on 4 songs and it stops (you can restart), but you cannot pause in mine. The sound controls look pretty decent on the wall to for easy use.

## Lighting

Thirdly, I like the party mode/disco lighting that was implemented when you hit the button on the wall. They used a custom lighting model instead of the usual point light and what not. That is a really creative use of lighting in a scene. A gif of that:

 ## Effective Use of Space

Lastly, the use of the sound room and more to convert into a music room and kitchen was nicely done. The objects there are appropriate. Also, this gives the team an opportunity to fill the scene with more objects.

Final thoughts would be how they also implemented frame rates well. On my laptop, the executable lagged a bit. However, the demonstration on the Vive in the classroom had ample frame-rate and was decent. This was the first project I found particularly good.
