For two weeks, I will discuss about two technologies that I found interesting and were discussed in class by fellow students. I will present my views on the technology, a brief introduction to the technology, the pros/cons, applications, a little bit about the company behind the technology, and finally a conclusive thought. Let us get started on the first one.

## Pimax 8K

Pimax 8K is a VR headset developed by Pimax. Pimax is a company founded by a team of VR enthusiasts in San Jose, CA that develops high end VR headsets. They started with the Pimax 4k [(VR in 4K resolution)](https://www.pimaxvr.com/en/4k/) and made it commercially viable. Their next project is the Pimax 8k.

We'll go over these differences in the pros/cons section of the review. The one great thing I liked about this project was the [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pimax8kvr/pimax-the-worlds-first-8k-vr-headset) effort. As of this post's date of writing, they have secured $4.2 million in funding! If the product was not genuine or really helpful, they would never have gotten the public trust for a crowdsourcing funding effort such as that.

Let us look at the pros and cons of the product:

### PROS vs CONS

1. **7680x2160 resolution:** This is important because VR headsets of today lack the clarity or crispness in viewing. A higher resolution also means a more immersive sense of VR to the end user. We do not want to see a pixelated view of the virtual world as it would detach us further from sense of reality. We want the VR world to feel as natural and real as the real world.

2. **200Â° Field of Vision:** A wider field of vision means the user is not limited to the restricted FOV of today's headsets. Increasing the field of view also
