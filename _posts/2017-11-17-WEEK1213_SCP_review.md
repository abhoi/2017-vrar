title: Student Choice Presentation Technologies Review

For two weeks, I will discuss about two technologies that I found interesting and were discussed in class by fellow students. I will present my views on the technology, a brief introduction to the technology, the pros/cons, applications, and finally a conclusive thought. Let us get started on the first one.

## Pimax 8K

Pimax 8K is a VR headset developed by Pimax. Pimax is a company founded by a team of VR enthusiasts in San Jose, CA that develops high end VR headsets. They started with the Pimax 4k [(VR in 4K resolution)](https://www.pimaxvr.com/en/4k/) and made it commercially viable. Their next project is the Pimax 8k. Now, at first glance, this may look like some ordinary VR headset like the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. However, there are some careful differences between the Pimax 8k and others. We'll go over these differences in the pros/cons section of the review. The one great thing I liked about this project was the [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pimax8kvr/pimax-the-worlds-first-8k-vr-headset) effort. As of this post's date of writing, they have secured $4.2 million in funding! If the product was not genuine or really helpful, they would never have gotten the public trust for a crowdsourcing funding effort such as that.

Let us look at the pros and cons of the product.

### PROS vs CONS

First, the pros:

1. **7680x2160 resolution:** This is important because VR headsets of today lack the clarity or crispness in viewing. A higher resolution also means a more immersive sense of VR to the end user. We do not want to see a pixelated view of the virtual world as it would detach us further from sense of reality. We want the VR world to feel as natural and real as the real world.

2. **200Â° Field of Vision:** A wider field of vision means the user is not limited to the restricted FOV of today's headsets. Increasing the field of view also gives the user access to peripheral vision. This enables the user to see movement and actions that are not directly in the line of sight. This also gives a more realistic sense of vision than normal headsets.

3. **90Hz Refresh Rate!**: This, for me, is one of the most impressive feats for this piece of technology. This is because we want to ensure the user feels almost zero latency or lag when in the VR world. A higher refresh rate (a gamer will tell you why it matters) results in more responsive object reactions, actions, and responses from the user.

4. **No ScreenDoor effect: **: The ScreenDoor effect refers to the terribly exaggerated pixel lines that are shown to user in small resolution devices. It can get really annoying after a while as it removes the facade of virtual worlds. Also, no screendoor effect means drastically minimized **motion sickness**.

Now, the cons:

1. **Hardware Requirements**: The hardware requirements required to drive this system is infeasible for normal day use by a far mile. The company recommends running the headset on at least a Nvidia GTX 970 GPU (for 8KX you need **GTX 1080 Ti/Volta/Tesla!**), internal upscaling, and Brainwarp. This can be hard for people to acquire to run the headset. They may rather just prefer a HTC Vive or Oculus Rift to this when it comes to convenience.

2. **Availability/Funding**: Most of these kinds of projects get funded from crowdsourcing which hinders venture capitalists from investing in such companies. This would probably force the company to stop making the product due to the constraints. Secondly, the availability of this product says February 2018 but could easily be delayed due to production resource constraints. Pimax really needs to sort these issues out before declaring it a success.

### Applications

Where can a product like this be useful?

1. **Military**: A great application would be in the military where even a miniscule detail can be the discriminatory factor between someone's life or death. Military personnel usually look for terrorists or bombs or IEDs and technology like this can make it easier for them to spot such things. Training recruitments to simulate real, war-like conditions is another way the military can use them.

2. **Medical**: The medical industry can definitely benefit from the 8K resolution as they need to usually be insanely precise with their procedures. This applies heavily to surgeons performing intricate procedures.

3. **Art**: The art industry can definitely benefit from the extra saturation, field of view, and resolution to explore and immerse themselves into artwork.

There are many applications possible for this technology and can be extended to almost any field.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I believe Pimax has come up with a brilliant product with great aspirations. They have raised the bar when it comes to resolution, refresh rates, quality, and precision. This is almost like a warning to big VR headset manufacturers to step up their standards of what they consider virtual reality. However, this also brings the problem of audience scope. Currently, the Pimax 8K is geared towards VR enthusiasts and the VR development and education industry. In no way is it ready for mass-scale production and end user consumption. I hope these problems can be broken through as it is a great product.
